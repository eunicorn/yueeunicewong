            <h1 class="section-title">Redesign Study Abroad at UC San Diego <span><img src="img/aeroplane.png"/></span></h1>
            <p>Planning for study abroad should be easy and exciting!</p><br>

            <h2 class="section-title">Challenges & Goals</h2>
            <p>Many students at UC San Diego complained about how not user-friendly the study abroad website is. It is not only difficult to find the information they need to know before going study abroad, but also navigate around the website. In a team of three, we decided to gather a deeper understanding of our users and redesign the website.</p>
            <p>The purpose of this redesign is to develop skills in information architecture based on user needs.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">My Role</h2>
            <p>As the design and team lead, I managed the project and assigned tasks. This role also included drawing wireframes, developing information architecture, and maintaining a clear communication across all team members.</p>
            <p>Things that I did:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>I interviewed users and created personas to create ideal users.</li>
                <li>I found different use cases and user scenarios to understand the problems that we need to solve.</li>
                <li>I conducted competitive analysis on five other university sites that offer study abroad opportunities to see how their information architecture, navigations, and layouts differ.</li>
                <li>I created an interactive low-fidelity prototype using Balsamiq.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="section-title">User Research</h2>
            <p>First, each of us interviewed four people to gain a deeper understanding of the users of this site. These interviewers are people who are considering study abroad, people who have applied, and people who have returned from the programs.</p>
            <p>Here are a few questions that we asked our interviewers:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Where and when did you study abroad? Why?</li>
                <li>What did you wish to accomplish or gain during your time abroad?</li>
                <li>How was your experience in researching the program?</li>
                <li>What is one thing you wish you knew before you went?</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3 class="section-title">Creating Personas</h3>
            <p>After learning about our users, I was tasked with creating a persona for students who are thinking about study abroad.</p>
            <p><b>Persona 1: Students who are thinking about study abroad</b></p>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <p>Name: Claire Li</p>
                    <p>Age: 19 years old</p>
                    <p>Her background:</p>
                    <p>She was born and raised in San Francisco, California. She does not travel much because her parents are always busy working. She has only been to China because her grandparents live there, so she wants to travel to somewhere she has never been, like Europe. Since she has been in California her whole life, she wants to experience new cultures, see different landscapes, and meets new friends. She does not know exactly where in Europe because she needs to do more research about studying abroad. Since her parents are not very wealthy, it is important for her to look for a program that is affordable and fits her school schedule. She wants to take classes abroad that fulfill her GEs so she does not have take a fifth year.  Budget and time are her main concerns. Overall, she is eager to travel but she also needs to prioritize school and money before she makes any decisions.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-4">
                    <img class="img-thumbnail" src="img/persona.jpg"/>"
                </div>
            </div>
            <h3 class="section-title">Finding User Scenarios and Use Cases</h3>
            <p>After creating three different personas, we used them as our model users to help us understand the goals, motivations, and behaviors of our users. Learning from these users, we were able to develop user scenarios and use cases.</p>
            <p>An example of a user scenario for Claire:</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 20px;">Claire wants to know what is the application process</p>
            <p>Use Cases from the above scenario:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Who can I talk to for questions? Any advisors?</li>
                <li>What are the deadlines?</li>
                <li>Do I need any health examinations?</li>
                <li>What are some specific requirements for qualifications to study abroad?</li>
                <li>What are the paperworks that I need to fill out?</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="center">
                <img style="height: 350px" src="img/designs/use-cases.jpg"/>
            </div>

            <h2 class="section-title">Competitive Analysis</h2>
            <p>Next, I conducted a competitive analysis on five different universities to understand how each differ in categorizing topics regarding to study abroad. We needed to know what were the most common and needed labels.</p>
            <div class="center">
                <img style="height: 350px;" src="img/designs/labels.jpg"/>
            </div>

            <h2 class="section-title">Difficult Design Decisions</h2>
            <p>Many difficult decisions we faced revolved around information architecture and the use of labels.</p>
            <ol>
                <div class="panel-group">
                    <div class="panel panel-default">
                        <div class="panel-heading">
                            <h3 class="panel-title">
                                <a data-toggle="collapse" href="#collapse1"><li>What categories should be on our navigation bar?</li></a>
                            </h3>
                        </div>
                        <div id="collapse1" class="panel-collapse collapse">
                            <div class="panel-body">
                                <p> To apply more focus on the user, and to distinguish between users and topics, we placed specific types of users in the navbar so users can access information that is more immediately relevant to themselves. It was difficult to decide whether labels for topics should have another menu, secondary navbar, or sidebar, created for them as we didn’t want to leave out vital information that users might want to access. However, we didn’t want to clutter our home page with a melange of various links that might overwhelm the user. So from the original Study Abroad site for UCSD, we narrowed down to 3 important topics to highlight on the homepage. Because these links were of high importance, but not located in our redesigned navbar, we added them to our body with 3 large, distinct circles to add to the top of the body of the homepage in a minimalistic fashion which included 1)What is Study Abroad? , 2) Deadlines, and 3) Finances.</p>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="panel-group">
                    <div class="panel panel-default">
                        <div class="panel-heading">
                            <h3 class="panel-title">
                                <a data-toggle="collapse" href="#collapse2"><li>What content should be included in the second level pages?</li></a>
                            </h3>
                        </div>
                        <div id="collapse2" class="panel-collapse collapse">
                            <div class="panel-body">
                                <p>While it is true that the scope of second level pages is smaller, we had trouble knowing which subtopics within that category are more important than others since “finance”, “prospective students” and “let’s get started” cover a wide range of information. For example, finance can mean a lot of things, such as scholarships, financial aid, travel budget, program costs, and currency. With so many different topics to include, our main concern was the clarity of our layout. Is it easy for our users to find the specific information they need? How do we group the different sub-topics that fall within the same category? Do we need another navbar to distinct the sub-topics? How do we show the content without making the page too overwhelming? After hours of discussions, we decided to have each subtopic in the second level pages to have their own buttons with a short description that will allow users to click on and take them to a more detailed page about that specific topic. The reason for this minimalistic design is because we want to abstract the detailed information away so that users can locate their need as fast as possible when they first land on the page.</p>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="panel-group">
                    <div class="panel panel-default">
                        <div class="panel-heading">
                            <h3 class="panel-title">
                                <a data-toggle="collapse" href="#collapse3"><li>What should we name our labels?</li></a>
                            </h3>
                        </div>
                        <div id="collapse3" class="panel-collapse collapse">
                            <div class="panel-body">
                                <p>Since our design focused on minimalism and we did not want to include long explanations in our pages, we were very careful in choosing the name of our labels. We wanted to make sure users know exactly what to click on to get the information they need without any hesitation. One struggle that we had was how we could differentiate students who are thinking about study abroad and students who have already chosen a program but have not gone yet. We spent a lot of time discussing the definition of a prospective student, but realized we should have been thinking about what information is relevant to either. Instead of splitting the participants into those applying and those accepted, we categorized the two groups of applicants as one to allow the user to access all relevant information for all things related to the entire application and preparation process.</p>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </ol>

            <h2 class="section-title">Final Product</h2>
            <p>After many iterations and discussions about the redesign and how it fits with our use cases, we created an interactive low-fidelity of the redesign using balsamiq to showcase a few different use cases.</p>
            <p>Together, we designed:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Landing page</li>
                <li>3 Second-level pages</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Home > Let's Get Started</li>
                    <li>Home > Prospective Students</li>
                    <li>Home > Finances </li>
                </ul>
                <li>A deep dive of a single use case: "Do I need any health examination before going study abroad?"</li>
                <ul><li>Home > Prospective Students > Health, Safety & Insurance</li></ul>
            </ol>
            <div class="center">
                <img style="height: 500px;" class="img-thumbnail" src="img/balsamiq/home.png"/><br>

                <p>In addition, I used pen and paper to create a mobile prototype.</p>
